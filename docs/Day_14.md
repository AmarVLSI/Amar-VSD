## 14.1 What is SPICE and why do we need SPICE simulations ?
### 14.1.1 What is SPICE ?
Fabricating ICs is very expensive and time-consuming, so designers need simulation tools to explore the design space and verify designs before they are fabricated. Simulation is cheap, but silicon revisions (even a single Metal layer change) are prohibitively expensive.  

Simulators operate at many levels of abstraction, from process through architecture.
  - Process simulators such as SUPREME predict how factors in the process recipe such as time and temperature affect device physical and electrical characteristics.
  - Circuit simulators such as SPICE and Spectre use device models and a circuit netlist to predict circuit voltages and currents, which indicate performance and power consumption.
  - Logic simulators such as VCS and ModelSim are widely used to verify correct logical operation of designs specified in a hardware description language (HDL).
  - Architecture simulators, sometimes offered with a processorâ€™s development toolkit, work at the level of instructions and registers to predict throughput and memory access patterns, which influence design decisions such as pipelining and cache memory organization.

The various levels of abstraction offer trade-offs between degree of detail and the size of the system that can be simulated. VLSI designers are primarily concerned with circuit and logic simulation.

SPICE (Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis) was originally developed in the 1970s at University of California, Berkeley. It solves the nonlinear differential equations describing components such as transistors, resistors, capacitors, and voltage sources.  

Based on the original SPICE, there are many SPICE versions available - both free (like Ngspice, Xyce, LTSpice, TINA-TI) as well as commercial (HSPICE, PSPICE). All versions of SPICE read an input file and generate an output  with results, warnings, and error messages. The input file is often called a _**SPICE deck**_ and each line is called a _**card**_ because it was once provided to a mainframe as a deck of punch cards.  

A circuit simulator is provided with an input file that contains:
  - A _**netlist**_ consisting of components and nodes detailing the circuit connectivity.  
    The netlist can be entered by hand or extracted from a circuit schematic or layout in a CAD program.
  - Component behaviour by means of _**device models**_ and _**model parameters**_.
  - The Initial state of the circuit -- _**initial conditions**_ 
  - Inputs to the circuit, called _**stimulus**_
  - _**Simulation options**_ & _**analysis commands**_ that explain the type of simulation to be run.

**Analysis Types supported by SPICE:**
| Analysis Type | Details |
|:---|:---|
| DC Analysis | Find the DC operating point of the circuit i.e., all voltages and currents |
| AC Small-Signal Analysis | AC analysis is limited to analog nodes and represents the small signal, sinusoidal solution of the analog system described at a particular frequency or set of frequencies.
| Transient Analysis | Transient analysis is an extension of DC analysis to the time domain. In other words, it solves a DC Analysis for each timestep based on initial conditions. |
| Pole-Zero Analysis | Computes the poles and/or zeros in the small-signal ac transfer function. |
| Small-Signal Distortion Analysis | Computes steady-state harmonic and intermodulation products for small input signal magnitudes. |
| Sensitivity Analysis | Calculate either the DC operating-point sensitivity or the AC small-signal sensitivity of an output variable with respect to all circuit variables, including model parameters. |
| Noise Analysis | Measures the device-generated noise for a given circuit. |

### 14.1.2 Why SPICE in VLSI Design ?

### 14.2.2 Transistor Operation: Cut-off Region, Surface Inversion & Threshold Voltage

  - Without the application of a Gate potential, the transistor is said to be in **Cut-off region** as there is no conducting path between the Source and Drain terminals. 
  - On the application a sufficiently high Gate-to-Source voltage, a conductive channel starts to form underneath the Gate composed of minority carriers (electrons in an NMOS) and at a certain voltage called the _**Threshold voltage**_,  _**surface inversion**_ occurs when the concentration of minority carriers in the channel becomes equal to the concentration of majority carriers in the bulk.
  - When VGS is increased further by several $\Phi_t (=thermal voltage, \dfrac{k_B T}{q}) $, the transistor moves into the _**strong inversion region**_. Here, the minority carrier concentration in the channel is a strong function of the applied gate potential.

### 14.2.3 Effect of Subtrate/ Body Bias on Threshold Voltage

  - The Source-to-Substrate amd Drain-to-Substrate pn junctions must always be reverse biased for the "normal operation" of the MOS transistor, so $V_{SB}, V_{DB}$ must always be greater than or equal to zero for an NMOS transistor.
  - If $V_{SB} = 0$, then surface inversion is achieved at a Gate-to-Source voltage equal to **VT0**
  - However, when $V_{SB} > 0$, the electrons from the channel can move laterally and flow out of the source terminal resulting in a reduced carrier concentration in the channel.
  - Thus, with when $V_{SB} > 0$, a higher Gate-to-Source voltage is required to achieve surface inversion.
  - In other words, the threshold voltage of an NMOS increases when $V_{SB} > 0$.

### 14.2.4 Resistive/ Linear Region of Operation

#### 14.2.4.1 Derivation of Drain Current, $I_D$
Let us analyse the condition when we apply a Gate-Source potential, $V_{GS} >= V_{TH}$ and a small value of $V_{DS}$ is applied across the channel from Drain-to-Source.

| ![CircuitDesignWorkshop_D1_NMOS_ResistiveRegion_Small_VDS](/docs/images/CircuitDesignWorkshop/CircuitDesignWorkshop_D1_NMOS_ResistiveRegion_Small_VDS.png) |
|:---|

Using a simple first-order analysis, let us try to derive an equation for the Drain Current, $I_D$ that results due to the $V_{GS}$ and $V_{DS}$ values applied. The mechanism for the Drain current, $I_D$ is  **carrier drift** under the lateral electric field due to $V_{DS}$.

  - Let $V_{GS}$ be held constant at a value greater than $V_T$.  
  - The applied $V_{DS}$ appears as a voltage drop across the length of the channel.  
  - As we travel along the channel from Source to Drain, the voltage (measured relative to the Source terminal) increases from zero to $V_{DS}$.
  - Thus the voltage between the gate and points along the channel decreases from $V_{GS}$ at the Source end to $V_{GD} = V_{GS}-V_{DS}$ at the Drain end.


  - At a point x along the channel, the voltage is $V(x)$, and the gate-to-channel voltage at that point equals $V_{GS} â€“ V(x)$.

Under the assumption that this voltage exceeds the threshold voltage all along the channel, the induced channel charge per unit area at point x can be computed.

$Q_i(x) = -C_{ox} [V_{GS} - V(x) -V_T]$  
$where:$  
$~~~~~~~~ C_{ox} = \dfrac{\epsilon_{ox}}{t_{ox}}$

The current is given as the product of the drift velocity of the carriers, $v_n$ and the
available charge. Due to charge conservation, it is a constant over the length of the channel.
W is the width of the channel in a direction perpendicular to the current flow.

$I_D = -v_n(x) * Q_i(x) * W$

The electron velocity is related to the electric field through a parameter called the mobility $\mu_n$ (expressed in $\dfrac{m^2}{V.s}$). The mobility is a complex function of crystal structure, and local electrical field. In general, an empirical value is used.

Drift velocity, $v_n = -\mu_n \dfrac{dV}{dx}$

$\therefore I_D = -\mu_n \dfrac{dV}{dx} * -C_{ox} [V_{GS} - V(x) -V_T] * W$  

$i.e., I_D dx = \mu_n C_{ox} W [V_{GS} - V(x) -V_T] dV$

Integrating the equation over the length of the channel L yields the voltage-current relation of the transistor:  
$I_D = {k_n}^\prime \dfrac{W}{L} \left[ (V_{GS}-V_T)V_{DS} - \dfrac{{V_{DS}}^2}{2} \right]
     = k_n \left[ (V_{GS}-V_T)V_{DS} - \dfrac{{V_{DS}}^2}{2} \right]$

$where:$  
$~~~~~~~~ {k_n}^\prime$ is the _process transconductance parameter._  
$~~~~~~~~ {k_n}^\prime = \mu_nC_{ox}$

The product of process transconductance, ${k_n}^\prime$ and the $\dfrac{W}{L}$ ratio of the transistor is called the _gain factor_, $k_n$ of the device.

$~~~~~~~~ k_n = {k_n}^\prime * \left( \dfrac{W}{L} \right)$

Now, the above equation for Drain Current:  
$I_D = k_n * \left[(V_{GS} - V_{TH}) * V_{DS} - \dfrac{V_{DS}^2}{2}\right]$
is a quadratic function of $V_{DS}$.  
But at low values, the $\dfrac{V_{DS}^2}{2}$ term can be ignored as it is close to zero. Hence the equation for $I_D$ can be approximated to be a linear function of $V_{DS}$:  
$i.e., I_D = k_n * (V_{GS} - V_{TH}) * V_{DS}$

For the example scenario we were discussing, this translates to:

### 14.2.5 Saturation/ Pinch-Off Region of Operation
  - When a $V_{DS}$ voltage is applied, the channel voltage becomes a function of both $V_{GS}$ and $V_{DS}$.
  - Since the induced channel depth depends on the channel voltage relative to the Gate terminal, and specifically on the amount by which this voltage exceeds the threshold voltage, $V_{TH}$, we find that the channel is no longer of uniform depth; rather, the channel will take a tapered shape:
    - being deepest at the Source end, where the depth is proportional to $[V_{GS}-V_{TH}]$, and
    - shallowest at the drain end, where the depth is proportional to $[V_{GS}-V_{TH}-V_{DS}]$.
  
  - As the value of the Drain-Source voltage is increased further, the assumption that the channel voltage is larger than the threshold all along the channel ceases to hold.
    - In the limiting case, the channel depth at the drain end reduces to zero and the channel is said to be **"pinched-off"**. This happens when $V_{GD}$ is just equal to the threshold voltage, $V_{TH}.
      - i.e., $V_{DS}= V_{GS} - V_{TH} ~~~~~~~~ (=V_{OV})$
  - At that point, the induced charge is zero, and the conducting channel disappears or is pinched off starting from the Drain end.
